# MoE Kernel Implementation Summary

This implementation provides the foundation for high-performance Mixture of Experts (MoE) kernels on Intel XPU using CUTLASS and SYCL.

## What's Implemented

### 1. Complete MoE Architecture (Foundation)
- **Headers**: `include/sgl_moe_kernel_ops.h` - Function declarations for MoE operations
- **Implementation**: `src/sycl/fused_moe.cpp` - Stub implementations ready for CUTLASS kernel integration
- **Python Interface**: `python/sgl_kernel/moe.py` - High-level API with PyTorch fallbacks
- **Build Integration**: CMakeLists.txt and torch extension registration framework

### 2. Key Functions
- `fused_moe_forward()` - Main MoE computation kernel
- `moe_align_block_size_xpu()` - Token alignment for optimal memory access
- `moe_grouped_gemm_xpu()` - Batched GEMM for expert computation  
- `silu_and_mul_moe_xpu()` - SiLU activation with gating

### 3. Build System
- ✅ Compiles successfully with Intel SYCL compiler
- ✅ Integrates with existing sgl-kernel build process
- ✅ PyTorch extension registration framework ready
- ✅ CUTLASS dependency resolved and included

## Current Status

### Working Components
- [x] Build system integration
- [x] Python API with graceful fallbacks
- [x] Function signatures compatible with PyTorch
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and examples
- [x] Test framework ready for validation

### Next Steps (For Production)
- [ ] Implement actual CUTLASS kernels (currently stubs)
- [ ] Enable XPU kernel registration in torch extension
- [ ] Performance optimization and tuning
- [ ] Comprehensive testing on Intel XPU hardware

## Usage Example

```python
from sgl_kernel.moe import fused_moe_forward
import torch

# Create test inputs
hidden_states = torch.randn(1024, 2048, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='xpu')
gate_weights = torch.randn(8, 2048, 8192, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='xpu')
up_weights = torch.randn(8, 2048, 8192, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='xpu')
down_weights = torch.randn(8, 8192, 2048, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='xpu')
topk_weights = torch.randn(1024, 2, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='xpu')
topk_indices = torch.randint(0, 8, (1024, 2), dtype=torch.int64, device='xpu')

# Run MoE forward pass
result = fused_moe_forward(
    hidden_states, gate_weights, up_weights, down_weights,
    topk_weights, topk_indices, top_k=2
)
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **CUTLASS Integration**: Leverages Intel's optimized CUTLASS fork for XPU
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Token alignment and grouped operations reduce memory overhead
3. **Fallback Safety**: PyTorch implementations ensure compatibility
4. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new MoE variants and optimizations

This foundation is ready for CUTLASS kernel development and integration into the SGLang framework.
